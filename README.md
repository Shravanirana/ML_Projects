🏠 House Price Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based regression model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, bathrooms, and more. It is designed to help buyers, sellers, and real estate agents estimate property values quickly and accurately.

🔍 Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that takes input features about a house and outputs an estimated price. The model is trained on a real estate dataset using machine learning algorithms.

✅ Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training with regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model evaluation using R² Score, RMSE, etc.

Interactive frontend using Streamlit or Gradio

Save and load model pipeline using pickle

📊 Model Inputs
Location

Area (in square feet)

Number of bedrooms (BHK)

Number of bathrooms

Parking, Furnishing, etc. (depending on dataset)

🎯 Target Variable
House price (usually in local currency, e.g., INR, USD)

📈 Results
The model performs well on the test data, achieving a reasonable R² score and low RMSE, depending on the dataset used. Further optimization can improve accuracy.

📌 Future Improvements
Add more features like year built, amenities, etc.

Integrate real-time data scraping

Deploy on cloud (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.)
